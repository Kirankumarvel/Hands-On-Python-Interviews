print(even_squares)

# This code generates a list of squares of even numbers between 1 and 20 (inclusive).
# It uses a list comprehension, which is a concise way to create lists in Python.
# The `range(1, 21)` generates numbers from 1 to 20.
# The `if x % 2 == 0` condition filters the numbers to include only even ones.
# The `x**2` computes the square of each even number.
# Finally, the resulting list of squares is printed to the console.
